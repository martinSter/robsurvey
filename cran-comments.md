## Resubmission
This is the second resubmission. In the first resubmission I have:

* Used single quotes for software names in the DESCRIPTION file.
* Added a reference about the method to the Description field.
* Fixed the invalid URLs in the vignette and the README file.

In the second resubmission I have:

* Used message() instead of cat() to print information to console.
* Replace return() with the more appropriate stop() in some cases.
